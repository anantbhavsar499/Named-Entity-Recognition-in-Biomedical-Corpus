# Named-Entity-Recognition-in-Biomedical-Corpus(NLP Term Project)

Named Entity Recognition is important part of information extraction from clinical documentation.
In this project we have trained Bidirectional LSTM-CRF model for Sequence Tagging on Biomedical Corpus.\
The dataset include NCBI-IOB, BC5CDR-disease-IOB and BC5CDR-IOB. NCBI-IOB and BC5CDR-disease-IOB include diseases only
whereas BC5CDR-IOB include diseases as well as chemicals.\
We have used pre-trained word embeddings including word2vec and glove.
